# Hospital Management System (ASP.NET Core MVC)

## Overview
Hospital Management System is a web application built with **ASP.NET Core MVC**, **Entity Framework Core**, and **Identity Scaffolding**.  
The system aims to manage hospital data (hospitals, patients, doctors, medical records) with secure authentication, authorization, and account management.  

This project was developed as an **individual task required by ITI**.  
I built it completely by myself, and it was later reviewed and verified by the supervisor.
